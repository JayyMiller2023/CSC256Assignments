        <p>During my childhood I liked playing games like super mario world, and Super Mario All-Stars, admittedly, I never played any Sega games while playing those retro games, then eventually I thought if I could make a game like that too? So I got to work on practicing on one sprite and that grew into more characters and then before I knew it, I started making pixel art of my own. The journey to mastering it took a bunch of tutorial videos, several references, and probably a lot of effort that had to be made making each one, however I never stopped trying to improve one after another, and I don't plan to stop any time soon.</p>

        <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
        <p>The Artstyle started with simple edits, but then started to get better, and sure there were a few hiccups and bumps on how to go about my work but eventually I started to slowly get more and more confident in my Artwork. I first started to learn on the basic design, then the shaders like flames. In the end, it is hard work and detication that gets you better and better with mastering the art of pixels, and If I could master this within a few years...</p>

        <h2>You can do so too!</h2>
        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
        <p>It's easy to start working, just search a pixel art app or platform and try to play around with the options, get familiar with the many tools you have at your disposal, and try to make something. If it comes down to it, you can try to watch tutorials on how to improve pixel art. With time, you can be good at Pixel Art and maybe surpass someone.</p>
